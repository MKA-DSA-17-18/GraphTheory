# GraphTheory Notes
## Terms
* Graph
  * a graph is a triple consisting of vertex set V(G), an edge set E(G) and a relation that associateds the two vertices with each edge. The vertices associated with each edge are called endpoints
  
* Vertex
  * fundamental piece of the graph

* Edge
  * connects verticies
  
* Loop
  * edge with just one endpoint
  
* mulitple edge
  * edge that shares verticies with another edge
  
* simple graph
  * a graph with no loops or multi-edges

* adjacent verticies
  * verticies connected by an edge
 
* Walk 
  * set of verticies that give directions from one vertex to another
 
* Path
  * a walk that touches a given vertex once
  
* Trail
  * a walk that doesn't pass over a given edge more than once

* Circuit
  * a trail that starts and ends at the same vertex
  
* cycle
  * walk that starts and ends in the same place
  
* Connected graph 
  * there exists a walk between any two points
  
* Disconnected graph 
  * a walk may not exist between any two points 
 
* Cyclic graph
  * a graph that contains a cycle
 
* Eulerian trail
  * a trail in a graph that contains all edges
  
* Eulerian Circuit
   a circuit that contains all the edges
